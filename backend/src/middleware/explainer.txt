auth.middleware.js: 
  1. authentication guard for protected routes
  2. Protects routes by verifying JWT tokens from cookies

1. Verifies token existence
2. Validates token signature using JWT_SECRET
3. Confirms user exists in database
4. Attaches authenticated user to request object (req.user)

Used in routes to:

  1. Restrict access to authenticated users only
  2. Provide user context to controllers
  3. Prevent unauthorized access to protected endpoints
  
The middleware is typically applied to routes that require authentication before accessing controller functions.
