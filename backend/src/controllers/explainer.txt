auth.controller.js: Handles authentication-related operations

Exports 5 main functions:
  1. signup: Creates new user with validation (min password length, unique email), hashes password, generates JWT token
  2. login: Authenticates user by comparing hashed password, generates JWT token on success
  3. logout: Clears JWT cookie
  4. updateProfile: Updates user profile picture using Cloudinary upload
  5. checkAuth: Verifies current authentication status by returning user data from JWT

message.controller.js: Handles messaging functionality

Exports 3 main functions:
  1. getUsersForSidebar: Returns all users except current user (for chat sidebar)
  2. getMessages: Retrieves message history between current user and specified user
  3. sendMessage: Creates new message (text or image via Cloudinary) between users

Key points:

  1. Both use async/await for database operations
  2. Consistent error handling with try/catch blocks
  3. Return appropriate HTTP status codes
  4. Use JWT authentication (req.user comes from auth middleware)
  5. Cloudinary integration for image handling
  6. Follows REST conventions for responses
